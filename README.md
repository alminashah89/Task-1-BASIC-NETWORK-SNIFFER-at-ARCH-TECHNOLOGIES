# Task-1-BASIC-NETWORK-SNIFFER-at-ARCH-TECHNOLOGIES
Cybersecurity Internship Task 1 BASIC NETWORK SNIFFER at ARCH TECHNOLOGIES
 Project: Basic Network Sniffer in Python
As part of my internship Arch Technologies, I built a network packet sniffer using Python and Scapy to capture and analyze real-time network traffic. This project helped me understand how data flows on a network and the structure of network packets.

Key Highlights:
Captures IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and ARP packets.
Displays packet details in a GUI table with live updates.
Logs all captured packets for later analysis.
Handles Windows-specific network restrictions using Layer 3 sniffing.
Built with Python, Scapy, Tkinter, and threading for smooth and responsive performance.

Skills Gained: Python programming, network protocols, packet analysis, GUI development, multithreading, and debugging on Windows.
💡 This project is a great demonstration of practical networking knowledge and Python automation skills.
